    "# Modeling Your Data - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you'll perform a full linear regression on the data. You'll implement the process demonstrated in the previous lesson, taking a stepwise approach to analyze and improve the model along the way.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "You will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove predictors with p-values too high and refit the model\n",
    "* Examine and interpret the model results\n",
    "* Split data into training and testing sets\n",
    "* Fit a regression model to the data set using statsmodel library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Build an Initial Regression Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To start, perform a train-test split and create an initial regression model to model the `list_price` using all of your available features.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** In order to write the model you'll have to do some tedious manipulation of your column names. Statsmodels will not allow you to have spaces, apostrophe or arithmetic symbols (+) in your column names. Preview them and refine them as you go.  \n",
    "**If you receive an error such as \"PatsyError: error tokenizing input (maybe an unclosed string?)\" then you need to further preprocess your column names.**"
